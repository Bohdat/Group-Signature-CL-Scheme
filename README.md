#Dynamic Group Signature library

This is the repository for Dynamic Group Signature by Camenisch-Lysyanskaya scheme.

###External dependencies:
Your system should have GMP lib 6.0.0 and PBC lib 0.5.14.
###Configuration
Pairing parameters was defined to default as PBClib example.
###How it works
Dynamic Group Signature Scheme

This scheme involves three types of participants:
```
group manger
group member
verifier
```
A dynamic group signature scheme consists of five polynomial-time algorithms/protocols:

* Key generation

Generation of group public key, member's secret issuer key and member's secret opener key.

* Join protocol

Registration of new group users, as a result, each user receives a own secret key from manager, who knows the secret issuer key.

* Signature generation

Each member of group with own secret key can produce the group signature on default message on behalf of group.

* Signature verification

Everyone who know group public key can verify the group signature.

* Opening procedure

Only group manager with secret opener key can open who is a singer on default group signature.
